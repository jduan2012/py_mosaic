# py_mosaic
Python program that creates mosaic images from a main photo comprised of many small images

Instructions:
1. from the directory containing main.py open cmd and type: python main.py
2. enter the path to the large image
3. enter the path to the folder containing your small images
4. enter a value between 1000 and 20000 (this will be the dimensions squared of the large image)
5. enter a value between 10-200 (this will be the dimensions of the small images that will make up your mosaic)
6. once main.py runs, a file called result.jpg will be saved in the folder containing main.py: if you like the result, rename it so it isn't overwritten when you run the program again.
7. repeat the process with different results until you get a file that you like.
